# Local Building Code & Zoning Compliance Reference Guide

## Overview
This document provides a framework for evaluating 3D-captured spaces against local building codes, structural requirements, and zoning regulations. Always cross-reference with current jurisdiction-specific requirements.

## Key Compliance Categories

### 1. Structural Requirements
- **Load-bearing walls**: Identify potential load-bearing walls (typically perpendicular to floor joists)
- **Ceiling heights**: Minimum 7'0" for habitable rooms (varies by jurisdiction)
- **Floor area**: Minimum room sizes vary by use (bedrooms typically min 70 sq ft)
- **Egress requirements**: Windows in bedrooms must meet egress standards (min 5.7 sq ft opening)

### 2. Electrical Code (NEC Reference)
- **Outlet spacing**: Receptacles every 12 feet along walls in living spaces
- **GFCI requirements**: Required in kitchens, bathrooms, garages, outdoors, basements
- **AFCI requirements**: Required in bedrooms, living rooms, hallways
- **Panel access**: 36" clearance required in front of electrical panels

### 3. Plumbing Code (IPC Reference)
- **Fixture clearances**: Toilets require 15" from center to side wall, 21" front clearance
- **Ventilation**: Bathrooms require mechanical ventilation or operable window
- **Water heater**: Must be accessible, proper drainage pan if in living space

### 4. Fire Safety
- **Smoke detectors**: Required in each bedroom, outside sleeping areas, every level
- **CO detectors**: Required near sleeping areas if gas appliances present
- **Fire extinguisher**: Recommended in kitchen, garage
- **Exit routes**: Two means of egress from each floor

### 5. Zoning Considerations
- **Permitted use**: Residential, commercial, mixed-use designation
- **Setbacks**: Distance requirements from property lines
- **Height restrictions**: Maximum building height for zone
- **Parking requirements**: Varies by use and jurisdiction
- **ADU regulations**: Accessory dwelling unit requirements if applicable

### 6. Energy Code (IECC Reference)
- **Insulation**: R-values vary by climate zone
- **Window efficiency**: U-factor and SHGC requirements
- **HVAC efficiency**: Minimum SEER ratings
- **Air sealing**: Blower door test requirements

## Common Violations to Check
1. Unpermitted additions or conversions
2. Bedroom without proper egress window
3. Bathroom without ventilation
4. Missing smoke/CO detectors
5. Improper electrical work (exposed wiring, overloaded circuits)
6. Water heater code violations
7. Stair riser/tread inconsistencies
8. Handrail height violations (34-38" required)
9. Guard rail height violations (36" min interior, 42" exterior)
10. Improper garage-to-house door (fire-rated required)

## Permit Requirements (General)
Work typically requiring permits:
- Structural changes (walls, foundations, roofing)
- Electrical work beyond simple replacements
- Plumbing work beyond fixture replacements
- HVAC installation or replacement
- Window/door additions or enlargements
- Deck/porch construction
- Garage conversions
- ADU construction

## Analysis Workflow
1. Identify jurisdiction from location data
2. Search for current local building codes
3. Evaluate space against general requirements
4. Note potential violations for further inspection
5. Recommend professional verification for any concerns
