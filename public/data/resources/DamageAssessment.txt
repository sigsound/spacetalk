# Property Damage Assessment & Fire Investigation Reference Guide

## Overview
This document provides a framework for insurance adjusters and investigators analyzing 3D-captured damaged properties. Focus on documenting damage patterns, potential origin points, and structural concerns.

## Fire Damage Assessment

### 1. Fire Origin Indicators
- **V-patterns**: Fire burns upward and outward creating V-shaped char patterns; the point of the V often indicates origin area
- **Pour patterns**: Irregular burn patterns on floors may indicate accelerant use
- **Low burn patterns**: Burns near floor level without explanation may indicate intentional ignition
- **Multiple origin points**: More than one distinct origin area suggests arson
- **Char depth**: Deeper charring indicates longer burn time or more intense heat

### 2. Heat and Smoke Patterns
- **Smoke staining**: Heavier at top of walls, can indicate fire movement direction
- **Heat shadowing**: Protected areas behind objects show less damage
- **Glass crazing**: Network of cracks in glass indicates rapid heating
- **Melted materials**: Note melting points (plastics ~200-400°F, aluminum ~1200°F, copper ~1900°F)
- **Color indicators**: 
  - Black soot: incomplete combustion
  - White/gray ash: complete combustion
  - Yellow/brown staining: slow smoldering fire

### 3. Electrical Fire Indicators
- **Arc mapping**: Document location of electrical arcs on wiring
- **Beading on wires**: Copper melting indicates electrical activity during fire
- **Outlet/switch damage**: Check for signs of electrical failure at origin
- **Appliance location**: Document appliances near suspected origin

### 4. Structural Damage Categories
- **Total loss**: Structure unsafe, complete demolition required
- **Major structural**: Load-bearing elements compromised
- **Moderate**: Significant damage but structure sound
- **Minor/cosmetic**: Smoke/water damage, surfaces affected

## Water Damage Assessment

### 1. Water Damage Classes
- **Class 1**: Minimal absorption, affects only part of room
- **Class 2**: Significant absorption, affects carpets and walls up to 24"
- **Class 3**: Greatest absorption, ceiling, walls, insulation saturated
- **Class 4**: Specialty drying, hardwood, concrete, plaster affected

### 2. Water Damage Categories
- **Category 1 (Clean)**: From sanitary source (broken supply line)
- **Category 2 (Gray)**: Contains contaminants (dishwasher, washing machine)
- **Category 3 (Black)**: Highly contaminated (sewage, flooding)

### 3. Mold Indicators
- **Visible growth**: Document location, extent, color
- **Musty odor**: Note areas with distinct smell
- **Timeline**: Mold can begin within 24-48 hours of water exposure
- **Hidden areas**: Check behind walls, under flooring, in HVAC systems

## Documentation Checklist

### General
- [ ] Full property address and date of loss
- [ ] Overall exterior shots showing all sides
- [ ] Aerial/bird's eye view if available
- [ ] Property boundaries and adjacent structures

### Fire Specific
- [ ] Suspected area of origin (multiple angles)
- [ ] V-patterns and char patterns
- [ ] Electrical panel condition
- [ ] Appliance locations and conditions
- [ ] Smoke detector locations and functionality
- [ ] Fire suppression system (if present)

### Water Specific
- [ ] Source of water intrusion
- [ ] Water lines/staining on walls
- [ ] Affected materials inventory
- [ ] Standing water depth measurements
- [ ] HVAC system condition

### Structural
- [ ] Foundation condition
- [ ] Load-bearing wall integrity
- [ ] Roof/ceiling damage
- [ ] Floor stability
- [ ] Stair and railing condition

## Analysis Workflow
1. Review location data and incident reports
2. Identify damage type(s) present
3. Document overall damage extent
4. Analyze patterns for origin/cause
5. Catalog affected materials and systems
6. Note safety hazards requiring immediate attention
7. Provide preliminary damage category assessment
8. Recommend areas for detailed professional inspection

## Red Flags for Investigation
- Damage inconsistent with reported cause
- Missing personal items (valuables removed before loss)
- Recent insurance policy changes
- Financial distress indicators
- Multiple prior claims
- Disabled safety systems
- Evidence of forced entry or staging
