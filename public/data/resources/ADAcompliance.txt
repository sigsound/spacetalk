================================================================================
SECTION 8: COMMON VISUAL COMPLIANCE ISSUES
================================================================================

This section highlights the most frequently observed ADA violations that
can be identified through visual inspection of photographs:

HIGH-FREQUENCY VIOLATIONS:
1. Missing or incorrect signage (no braille, wrong height, wrong location)
2. Round door knobs instead of lever handles
3. Inaccessible restrooms (no grab bars, insufficient space, high fixtures)
4. Missing detectable warnings at curb ramps
5. Protruding objects in circulation paths
6. Insufficient door maneuvering clearances
7. Ramps too steep or missing handrails
8. Inaccessible parking (wrong count, missing signs, no access aisles)
9. Counters too high without accessible section
10. Missing visual fire alarms (strobes)

ITEMS THAT CANNOT BE DETERMINED FROM PHOTOS ALONE:
- Exact slopes (need measurements)
- Door opening force (need gauge)
- Exact dimensions (need tape measure)
- Elevator audible signals
- Surface slip-resistance ratings
- Braille accuracy on signs (too small to read in most photos)

When analyzing photos, flag potential issues and note that on-site
measurement is needed to confirm specific dimensional violations.
